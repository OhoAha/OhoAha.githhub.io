<center><div class="t7"> Agile development becomes more popular due to its fast development, flexible, high customer satisfaction, and simultaneously can build a quality product. Regrettably, agile SDLC's fast nature and limited time make some agile organizations or developers neglecting the importance of integrating security throughout project development. There are a lot of issues and challenges that become the reason for many agile organizations leaving security behind despite knowing the significance of applying security in their product.Therefore, there are several requirements for security to properly integrate into the agile process.

        <p><b>Agile security practices for all team:</b></p>   
           
           <ol>
    <li>Review and document the significant threat and huge risk as needed while discarding intricate threat modeling processes and related software.Then, if the process fit the agile model, the team can swiftly implement the incremental change to the threat model, so that, they can proceed to development tasks.</li>
    <br>          
    <li>Install a static analysis tool on each developer’s device. This tool can give immediate           feedback for the developer to verify a code flaw and malicious code in the program.</li>
    <br>          
    <li>Configure dynamic analysis tools to frequently test the software running in the                   development staging and quality assurance environment. Therefore, for each short sprint,         the result of the automated test will be reduced to the code committed only, and it must         regularly monitor by the project team. It made the security agile during the development         test easy to manage.</li>
     <br>          
    <li>Add any identified security issues that prioritize a list of bugs enhancements and               requirements during the security tests to the product backlog. Usually, item in the               backlog is written as user stories.</li>
            
    
           </ol>
           
                
                <p>Sometimes, there are security issues that can be missed by the automated test during each sprint. So, it is best to have an expert security source code review and penetration test to identify the problem. Then, the problem will be added to the backlog. After that, when the security sprint is completed, do another penetration test to validate the fix and correction before approving the production release.</p>
                    
              <br>
            <br>
           
           
            <p><b>The security SME should :</b></p>   
           
           <ol>
    <li>Provide continuous security for each sprint through integration and monitoring to adapt it to the agile model.</li>
    <br>          
    <li>Adjust the task like application design attack surface analysis, threat modeling, and security architecture review to be as lightweight as possible. For example, at the beginning of the iteration, the team can do a short technical meeting or a simple questionnaire about the security task.</li>
    <br>          
    <li>Help the development team write unit tests for security-specific cases. Thus, it will make the development team can execute and monitor the unit test automatically.</li>
     <br>          
    <li>Review and identify the vulnerabilities and risky security elements like password management, validation libraries, encryption, and authentication. The experienced developer should modify these elements and monitor it on the build server for the code change.</li>
    <br>       
    <li>Assist the project team with examining the abuse stories in the backlog or the security-specific functional abuser and the writing testing.</li>
     <br>
     <li>Examine the current state of the application security when at the end of the sprint meeting. </li>
     <br>
           </ol>
           
                
        <p>At the end of the sprint, conduct a final security review. It is depending on the risk tolerance and the severity of the application. The product is ready to be released after enough secure iterations and feedback loops with the customer. Then, the product can be assumed to be secure and safe.</p>
