            <p>
                The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a framework that defines the development process used by 
                organizations to build an application. It is a continuous process starting from the decision to launch the 
                project and ends when the product is released to the targeted market and needs to be maintained. The conventional 
                SDLC consists of the following phases: 
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requirement analysis</li>
                    <li>Design and planning</li>
                    <li>Development</li>
                    <li>Testing</li>
                    <li>Deployment</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>
                What is SSDLC?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Secure SDLC (SSDLC) refers to the application of security practices throughout the various phases of the SDLC 
                to prevent coding errors and to discover and eliminate security flaws. With SSDLC, the goal is to minimize the 
                vulnerabilities present in the final software application. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Observation of security vulnerabilities from previous studies shows that the conventional SDLC is not enough to 
                secure software from security threats. This is why it becomes essential to incorporate security measures to 
                ensure that the developed system has all the required functionality and but also has as few security bugs as 
                possible. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Vulnerabilities may be introduced into the software at any phase of the SDLC. Therefore, the improved secure SDLC 
                includes security activities conducted in each phase of the SDLC, such as threat modelling, risk analysis, code 
                security review, vulnerability assessment, and penetration testing.
