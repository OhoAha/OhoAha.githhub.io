            <h1>
                Welcome to Secure Software Development Handbook!
            </h1>

            <p>
                Software developers are often under pressure to develop and deliver applications quickly with the specified 
                functionalities and may be unable to pay much attention to the security of their applications. They may regard 
                security as a ‘non-functional requirement’ under the constraints of time and development cost or even due to 
                lack of awareness. This results in the production of application security vulnerabilities, which can be 
                exploited by malicious actors to ultimately steal data, commit financial crimes, and more. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Most security vulnerabilities in an application arise from the absence of security measures. 
                An important step towards remedying this problem is raising awareness among 
                students and developers on security in software application development – which is what this website is all 
                about.  
            </p>

            <h2>
                Why do we need secure software development methodologies?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Until recently, security concerns were not considered until the testing phase, towards the end of the software 
                development lifecycle. At this point, it becomes more costly to fix bugs and flaws. Moreover, it is also 
                possible that the software testing does not reveal all the vulnerabilities.
            </p>

            <p>
                But when security is considered in each step of the software development process, starting from requirements 
                analysis, it is possible to not only catch bugs and flaws earlier on but also to prevent vulnerabilities from 
                being introduced to the application in the first place.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Challenges to implementing security in software development
            </h2>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of security knowledge and awareness</li>
                    <li>Time and development cost constraints</li>
                    <li>Insufficient security practices, skills, and tools</li>
                    <li>Insufficient resources and people</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
